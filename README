Google's HTML5 port of Bytonic Software's Java port of Id Software's Quake II

To install and run:
  ./install-resources (will download, unpak, and convert the original Quake II demo resources)
  ./build-dedicated-server (will build the client and server code)
  ./run-dedicated-server [port] (will run the local Quake II server)

Navigate to:
  http://localhost:8080/GwtQuake.html
  (or whatever port you specified to the server)

Eclipse setup:
  There are .classpath and .project files in the root, which you should be able
  to import directly.  It's setup to use the Google Plugin for Eclipse
  (http://code.google.com/eclipse/), though you should be able to get it
  working without that if you so desire. There's also a launch config in the
  root that will launch GwtQuakeServer on port 8080. Make sure you've run the
  maven scripts first, which bring in some dependencies.
